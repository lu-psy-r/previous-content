Open up the R server at psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk\n\n2.  In R studio, at the File menu, select New File, then R script.\n    Now, we can put in our favourite sum to check it's working.\n    At the top of the R script window type `10.5 + 7`.\n    With the cursor on the same line as the sum click on the Run button (or press Ctrl+Enter on Windows, Cmd+Enter on Mac).\n    In the console, you should see the sum being run, and the answer produced.\n\n3.  Save the R source.\n    Click on the Save icon, call the R script \"psyc401_week2.r\".\n    The .r subscript indicates to R studio that this is an R script file.\n\n4.  Close the R script, by clicking on the little x next to the R script filename just above the R script window.\n\n5.  Now open it again.\n    In the R studio window File menu, select Open File, and browse to where you saved your R script file and open it.\n\n6.  To make it easier to save and open files we can set what is called the \"working directory\" for R studio.\n    Click \"Session\" in the menu at the top of the R studio screen, select \"Working directory\", then select \"Choose directory\".\n    Browse to the Folder where you are going to save your PSYC401 R studio files (for me this is Documents/PSYC401), and click Open.\n    Over on the right lower panel, you should now see all the files that are in this Folder - including psyc401_week2.r\n\n## Task One: open and check Practical week1 workbook answers script file\n\n7.  Download the answers file by right-clicking the link and saving it.\n    [psyc401_week1_workbook_answers.r](answers/psyc401_week1_workbook_answers.r)\n\n8.  Open psyc401_week1_workbook_answers.r in R studio (File \\> Open File).\n    You can now look through this document, check your commands and answers to the tasks from last week.\n\n9.  Close the file psyc401_week1_workbook_answers.r\n\n## Task Two: Opening a data file\n\n10. Reopen your script file psyc401_week2.r in R studio.\n\n11. It's always a good idea to refresh and clear out R studio when you start a new session, so add this line to the beginning of your R studio file, `rm(list=ls())`\n\n12. Now we are going to open a new data file.\n    Download the file \"PSYC401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\" from moodle PSYC401 site, from the Practical Week2 folder.\n    Note: DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE IN EXCEL -- IF YOU DO, DELETE IT THEN DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN. Each row is one person's data, and each column is a measure taken from the person.\n    Columns are separated by commas, which is what the \"csv\" refers to\" comma-separated values.\n\n13. In R studio, we open csv files using a function called `read_csv()` which comes from a set of functions called \"tidyverse\", we can install these functions by putting `library(tidyverse)` at the very top of our R file.\n    Type this command in the script file and then run it:\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Want to know more about library()?\n\nR comes with certain functions pre-installed, such as `mean()`, but part of the charm of R is that we can install different functions that give us the opportunity to do *almost* anything!\nCollections of functions are called packages, and collections of packages are called libraries, but for the purpose of practicality, we typically refer to them interchangably.\nWe install libraries using `library()` and enter the name of the library in the brackets.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndat <- read_csv(\"PSYC401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nRemember the `dat <-` notation, which means we put the data into an object called \"dat\"\n\n14. If all went well, we can then look at the data, using the function `View`: In the script file type `View(dat)` and run it.\n    It should open a spreadsheet where we can see the data.\n\n15. Next, we just focus on two variables from the data: subject_ID which is the participants' anonymised number, and Gent_1\\_score, which is the participants' score on the Gent vocabulary test, the first time they had a go (that's what the 1 stands for).\n    We do this using the command select.\n    The command select is in the library \"tidyverse\".\n    In the script file type and run:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarydat <- select(.data = dat, subject_ID, Gent_1_score)\n```\n:::\n\n\n16. Finally, let's just have a quick look at these data.\n    In the script file type `hist(summarydat$Gent_1_score)` and run it.\n\n17. This will draw a histogram of the Gent vocabulary scores.\n    `summarydat$Gent_1_score` means that we look at the Gent_1\\_score values from the summarydat data -- the `$` indicates that this is one of the measures from the data.\n    What kind of pattern does the histogram show?\n\n# Part Two: Revision from last week\n\n18. Save your R script. Now, without looking at your notes, make a new object called \"iknow\", and assign this list of numbers to it: 126, 76, 98, 124, 91, 88, 99, 115, 80, 113, 90, 92, 97, 134, 110, 92, 92, 87, 135, 115\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nuse the `iknow <- c(number1, number2, …)` notation\n:::\n\n19. Remember to type these commands in the R script window.\n    Next, get R-studio to give you the mean and standard deviation of this list of numbers.\n\n20. Draw a histogram of the iknow data.\n\n# Part Three: More practice at opening files and manipulating data\n\nLoading data into R-studio\n\n21. Go to moodle PSYC401 week2, and download the data file called \"ahicesd.csv\" to your directory \"PSYC401/week2\". Now do the same for \"participantinfo.csv\". These data come from this study: Woodworth, R.J., O'Brien-Malone, A., Diamond, M.R. and Schüz, B., 2018. Data from, Web-based Positive Psychology Interventions: A Reexamination of Effectiveness. Journal of Open Psychology Data, 6(1).\n\nA brief description of the study is as follows: In our study we attempted a partial replication of the study of Seligman, Steen, Park, and Peterson (2005) which had suggested that the web-based delivery of positive psychology exercises could, as the consequence of containing specific, powerful therapeutic ingredients, effect greater increases in happiness and greater reductions in depression than could a placebo control.\nParticipants (n=295) were randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups referred to, in accordance with the terminology in Seligman et al. (2005) as 1: Using Signature Strengths; 2: Three Good Things; 3: Gratitude Visit; 4: Early Memories (placebo control).\nAt the commencement of the study, participants provided basic demongraphic information (age, sex, education, income) in addition to completing a pretest on the Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale.\nParticipants were asked to complete intervention-related activities during the week following the pretest.\nFuther measurements were then made on the AHI and CESD immediately after the intervention period ('posttest') and then 1 month after the posttest (day 38), 3 months after the posttest (day 98), and 6 months after the posttest (day 189).\nParticipants were not able to to complete a follow-up questionnaire prior to the time that it was due but might have completed at either at the time that it was due, or later.\nWe recorded the date and time at which follow-up questionnaires were completed.\n\n22. Next, load the data into R-studio. The first file is data from participants' self-ratings of happiness and depression. The second contains demographic information about the participants. Type `dat <- read_csv(\"ahicesd.csv\")`, run this command (type Ctrl-Enter), then type `pinfo <- read_csv(\"participantinfo.csv\")`, and run that. This has made two new objects -- one called \"dat\" which contains the experimental data, and one called \"pinfo\" which contains the demographic information.\n\n## Task Four: Examining and manipulating data\n\n23. Let's have a look at the data now.\n    Type `View(dat)` in the source and Run it in the console, and you should see the data appear above the console window.\n    Have a good long hard look at it.\n\n24. The data shows id which is the participant number, occasion which is whether this is the first (0), second (1), up to sixth (5) time they filled in the questionnaires, intervention is which intervention they took part in with respect to attempting to promote their mood, ahi01-ahi24 are the 24 items on the AHI happiness scale, cesd01-cesd20 are the 20 items on the CESD depression scale.\n    Way over on the right are the total scores on the AHI and the CESD questionnaires.\n\n25. Now, view the pinfo data.\n    How can you look at it?\n\n26. Looking at the data replaced the source window, but the source is still there.\n    Just above the View panel you should see a tab named \"psyc401_week2.r\", click on that to get your source panel back.\n    It will have a star/asterisk after the file name if it is unsaved.\n    Remember it's a good idea to regularly save your source file so you don't lose work.\n\n27. Now, we are going to join together the two files.\n    Type this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_dat <- inner_join(x = dat, y = pinfo, by = c('id', 'intervention'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n28. Question: what does the c(\"id\", \"intervention\") bit mean?\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\"} \\## Answer this means we match by two variables -- id and intervention.\nWe use the `c()` notation to indicate that this is a list of things.\n\nWe've now made a new data set called \"all_dat\".\nThe \"x = dat\" bit is the name of the first datafile we want to join, the \"y = pinfo\" is the name of the second datafile we want to join, the \"by = 'id', 'intervention'\" bit is the names of variables that the two datasets have in common.\n:::\n\n29. How would you join two data sets one called \"datamad\" the other called \"datasane\" together if they both have the variable \"participantname\" in common?\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_full <- inner_join(x = datamad, y = datasane, by = c(\"participantname\"))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n30. Now we just want to keep a few of the variables -- we're not interested in the individual questionnaire items. So, let's select the variables we want to keep:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarydata <- select(.data = all_dat, ahiTotal, cesdTotal, sex, age, educ, income, occasion, intervention)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhere \"all_dat\" is the name of the object to take data from, and \"ahiTotal, cesdTotal, sex, age, educ, income, occasion, intervention\" are all the variables we want to keep.\n\n31. Have a look at the summarydata in the View. How do you do that?\n\n## Task Five: Investigate data\n\n32. The next task is to have a closer look at the distributions of the data.\n    Let's focus on the age of participants.\n    To investigate one column of data from a dataset, you have to refer to it using the \"\\$\" symbol.\n    So, to investigate the \"age\" column from the \"summarydata\" dataset, you would look at summarydata\\$age.\n    Draw a histogram (bar graph) of the distribution of age in the participant sample.\n\n33. Now, let's look at how the AHI and the CESD scores relate.\n    To gain an impression of how two variables relate we can draw a scatter graph.\n    In the console, type `plot(summarydata$ahiTotal, summarydata$cesdTotal)`, press Return.\n    What does the \"\\$\" do in this command?\n    What relationship do you find between these two variables?\n\n34. Now make sure you save psyc401_week2.r that contains all these commands that you ran.\n    Close Rstudio, and Open Rstudio and make sure its saved all your work.\n    The list of commands is extremely useful for making science open and accessible to other researchers.\n    It's more and more common for psychology articles to make the R source files available so other researchers can reproduce the data manipulations and analyses used in the paper precisely.\n\n# Part Four: More (advanced) data manipulation\n\n35. For reading in more types of data, you can use commands other than `read_csv()`. Have a look at https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218611977-Importing-Data-with-RStudio and have a go at loading in excel files or text files with various formats into R-studio.\n\nNote that using lots of different resources online is one of the points of using R-studio -- everything is open and shared.\nIt isn't cheating - it's what everyone who uses R-studio does, it's what I did when I was checking some of the commands in this module - so do use google (or baidu, or any search engine) to explore other commands, and to get hints if you ever get stuck.\n\n36. What if the datafiles you wanted to combine together had different names for participants -- in datafile \"dataone\" it's called \"id\" and in datatwo\" it's called \"participant\". You can do this by specifying how variables in different datasets relate to each other. Take a look at the help information for inner_join by typing `?inner_join`, then in the help pane on the right, scroll down to find the section titled \"Arguments\", and read what it has to say about the argument \"by\". See if you can understand how to join these files together. The examples at the bottom of the help section may be useful too.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=\"false\" collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\n\nThe important help information is: \"To join by different variables on x and y, use a named vector. For example, by = c(\"a\" = \"b\") will match x\\$a to y\\$b.\"\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_full <- inner_join(x = dataone, y = datatwo, by = c(\"id\" = \"participant\"))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n37. In the data set from Woodworth et al., we might want to just look at the pretests.\n    We can use a function called `filter` to pull out just some of the rows.\n    Type `summarydata_occasion0 <- filter(.data = summarydata, occasion == 0)` this just pulls out the first occasion of testing (the pretest).\n    How would you pull out the second occasion of testing?\n\n38. How would you pull out just those participants who had the first intervention from the summarydata data?\n\n39. Back to the data set with just occasion == 0 selected.\n    Now plot the relationship between the AHI and CESD scores at this pretest.\n    What is the pattern now?\n\n40. How about just the participants who had intervention 1.\n    What is the relationship between their scores on the AHI and CESD in the first test?\n\n# Part Five: Different ways in which data are stored: long and wide data format\n\nWhen we look at other people's data sets there are two generic ways in which they can be presented.\nThe first is called \"wide format\", and this is when several measures are presented on a single row in the data.\nThis is the format of the data in the vocabulary scores: psyc401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv, where there are three vocabulary tests each in different columns.\nThe other format is called \"long format\", and this is where each observation is on a different line -- and if there is more than one observation from the same subject then that subject has multiple lines in the data.\nThere are some functions in the tidyverse library that helps us convert from wide to long and long to wide.\nThis part practises these conversions.\n\n## Task Six: Wide to long format conversion\n\n41. Let's go back to the psyc401-shipley-scores-anonymous-17_18.csv data.\n    This should still be in the object called \"dat\".\n    If it's not, then load the data again into dat, using the `read_csv()` function.\n\n42. Make sure the `library(tidyverse)` is loaded, if not, run the command `library(tidyverse)`.\n\n43. The aim here is to convert the data so that each Gent vocabulary score is on a separate line, we use the `pivot_longer` function for this.\n    First we specify what the new object should be (datlong), then we say where the old data is (dat), then we make a new variable to keep the names of the tests (names_to = \"test\"), then we make a new variable to keep the scores from the tests (values_to = \"vocab\"), then we specify the list of old variables to combine into the new scores variable (c(\"Gent_1\\_score\", \"Gent_2\\_score\") ) -- remember lists are written as c().\n    So, run this command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatlong <- pivot_longer(dat, names_to = \"test\", values_to = \"vocab\", cols = c(\"Gent_1_score\", \"Gent_2_score\")) \n```\n:::\n\n\n44. Have a look at the new object datlong that results: `View(datlong)`.\n    This function `pivot_longer` has taken as input the data in dat, it has created a new variable called \"test\" which reports whether it is the Gent_1\\_score or the Gent_2\\_score that is the measurement, and a new variable called \"vocab\" where the actual scores are listed.\n    Then, the following list of variables let's the function `pivot_longer` know which variables from the object dat we are converting (or lengthening).\n    It also includes all the other variables, but unconverted.\n    How many rows of data are there now corresponding to data from subject_ID number 1?\n\n45. Let's tidy things up so we only have subject_ID, and the Gent vocabulary scores by using select:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndatlongsummary <- select(datlong, subject_ID, test, vocab)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Task Seven: Long to wide format conversion\n\n46. Now, we will have a go at converting from long to wide format. Let's start with the datlongsummary object. We will convert this so that Gent_1\\_score and Gent_2\\_score are listed alongside each other -- one row per person. The command for this is the reverse of `pivot_longer`, called `pivot_wider.` Run this command: `datwide <- pivot_wider(datlongsummary, names_from = \"test\", values_from = \"vocab\")`. This command takes the data from datlongsummary and puts the different measures reported in the variable test into different columns again, filling in the values from the variable vocab.\n\n# Part Six: Getting ready for finding data sets (preparation for research report)\n\nThis part involves you exploring online psychology articles and finding an article which has made its data set available.\nMore and more journals require data to be available when articles are published, an influential journal that has supported open science practices is Psychological Science.\nGo to the webpage of Psychological Science: https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pss .\nBrowse the journal (you can view it on campus, off campus might be more difficult).\nArticles which have a dataset available have a \"badge\" indicating open data.\n\nIf data is made available, it is usually present as a \"Supplemental Material\" or via a link in the article (often data is stored on sites such as Open Science Framework (osf.io) or Figshare).\nFor example, for this article:\n\nat the end of the article there is a note on how to access the data:\n\nYour task is to: download an article, download its data, and be able to describe what is in the data -- i.e., what the rows and the columns in the data refer to.\nYou can do this individually or as a group.\nAt the next practical, you will talk one of the demonstrators through your description of the data.\n\nYou are free to explore the journal in its entirety to find an article that interests you, but some data sets can be really complicated to interpret.\nSome that you might begin with are as follows:\n\nvon Hippel, W., Ronay, R., Baker, E., Kjelsaas, K., & Murphy, S. C.\n(2016).\nQuick thinkers are smooth talkers: Mental speed facilitates charisma.\nPsychological Science, 27(1), 119-122.\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797615616255\n\ndata is available on osf.io (open science foundation) have a look in the Archive of OSF Storage for this article, under \"Clean Data\", \"Study 1 data long format.csv\".\nSee if you can figure that one out.\n\nAnother possibility is: Watson-Jones, R. E., Whitehouse, H., & Legare, C. H.\n(2016).\nIn-group ostracism increases high-fidelity imitation in early childhood.\nPsychological Science, 27(1), 34-42.\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797615607205 data is available on researchgate: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281283239_OstracismInGroups_Cyberball_DataFile_Deidentified\n\nThere are two things to be aware of with data.\n\n-   First, real life data is usually not complete -- it contains missing values.\n    The usual way to indicate missing values is \"NA\" in R.\n    But if the data set contains missing values indicated in a different way, then you have to specify this when you input the data.\n    So, if missing values are indicated by \"999\", you have to do it like this: `read_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\"999\")` where file.csv is the file you are inputting.\n    If missing values are indicated by \"na\", you have to do this: `read_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\"na\")`, if missing values are \".\", then like this: `read_csv(\"file.csv\", na.strings=\".\")`\n\n-   The second thing you might need to know is how to input files other than comma separated files.\n    For excel files, you need to do this: `install.packages(\"readxl\")` then `library(readxl)`, then you can use the command `read_excel(\"file.xls\")`, this should work for xls and xlsx files.\n    For inputting data that is in text, but not separated by commas, have a look at the help for the `read_csv()` function: `?read_csv`.\n    Hint -- you'll be looking to change the sep option for the read_csv command.\n",
