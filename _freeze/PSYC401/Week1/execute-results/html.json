Introducing Data\nsubtitle: Written by Padraic Monaghan\norder: 2\n---\n\n\n# Preparation\n\n- Watch [Lecture week1 part1](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1dc8e654-b996-4d2d-917c-adac00d6e6fd). Slides [here](ppt/wk1/PSYC401 Lecture week1 part1 handout.pptx)\n\n- Watch [Lecture week1 part2](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=2d1319ad-9f0b-4ec7-865f-ac4c00b40487), stop halfway through and do the [Lecture week1 part2 quiz](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1921414) (not assessed), go back and watch the end of Lecture week 1 part2. [slides here](ppt/wk1/PSYC401 Lecture week1 part2 handout.pptx)\n\n- Watch [Lecture week1 part3](https://dtu-panopto.lancs.ac.uk/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=273c848e-9c9a-459e-9e61-ac45015f7929).\n\n- Take the [quiz on the lecture material](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/quiz/view.php?id=1921415) (not assessed).\n\n- Work through the practical workbook in a group (...don't worry about groups yet, we will form them at the first practical, for now you can work on the practical workbook individually, or with anyone else on the course you are in touch with!)\n\n- Attend the practical on Wednesday.\n\n- Pop into the drop in (optional) on Thursday, if you'd like extra support for the practical materials, or have questions about the lecture material.\n\n- Optionally, watch the [lecture by Tim Harford](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=827528201352006) on the importance of understanding statistics.\n\n\nIn your group, work through this workbook, note any problems and questions you have, and come prepared to the online practical class to go through the tasks and ask your questions.\n\n- The first part of this workbook reproduces what you saw in the week 1 part 3 lecture.\n\n- The second part gives you some more exercises in using R studio for finding means, standard deviations, z scores, and drawing histograms.\n\n- The third part explores some more tasks you can do to practise exploring what R studio can do.\n\n# Part One: repeat the steps from lecture 1 part 3\n\n## Task One: Open Rstudio\n\n---\ntitle: \"Statistics for Psychologists\"\npage-layout: article\n---\n\nTo log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS' [instructions here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/vpn/) or connecting to Eduroam [here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/wi-fi/).\n\nWhen you are connected, navigate to [https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk](https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk), where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says \"Sign in with SAML\".\n\n![](/Includes/1LoginSAML.png) <!-- says no image but it's all about the include setup -->\n\nThis will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!\n\n![](/Includes/2LoginUser.png)\n\n![](/Includes/3LoginPass.png)\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIf you have already logged in through the university login already, perhaps to get to the portal, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.\n:::\n\n\n\n### What does RStudio look like?\n\nWhen RStudio starts, it will look something like this: ![Startup screen](images/RStudio_startup_screen.png)\n\nRStudio has three panels or windows: there are tabs for Console (taking up the left hand side), Environment (and History top right), Current file (bottom right). You will also see a 4th window for a script or set of commands you develop, also (on the left hand side).\n\n## Task Two: using the console\n\n::: callout-tip\nText that is highlighted with a grey background denotes code, rather than typiucal prose. Code is different to other forms of writing, such as essays, because the syntax, order and words need to be quite specific. For some longer chunks of code, as you will see below, they are formatted slightly differently.\n:::\n\n1. In the “console” part of the R window, next to the >, type `10 + 30`.  Press return.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n10 + 40                        \n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you hover your mouse over the box that includes the code snippet, a 'copy to clipboard' icon will appear in the top right corner of the box. Click that to copy the code. Now you can easily paste it into your script. \n:::\n\nIt should give you the answer 40.\n\n2.\tIn the console, type `a <- 40` and press Return.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\na <- 40                      \n```\n:::\n\n\nNow type `a` and press return. It should give you the answer 40. `a` is called an object, think of it like a bucket that you can keep a number, or some numbers, or actually all kinds of stuff in.\n\n3.\tNow let’s look at a function, `sqrt`. `sqrt` is a function that takes the square root of whatever is inside the brackets. In the console, type `sqrt(13)`. Press Return.\n\n4.\tNow find the square root of the object `a` by typing `sqrt(a)`. Press return.\n\n## Task Three: finding distributions\n\n5. Make a new object `b`, and put the following list of children’s attachment scores into it\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nb <- c( 4, 1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, 1, 6, 5, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 1, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 4, 8, 6, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 8, 8, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 8, 6, 7, 2, 7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n6.\tCheck it works by typing `b`, press return. \n\n7.\tFind the mean of these numbers by typing `mean(b)`.\n\n8.\tFind the median of these numbers by typing `median(b)`.\n\n9.\tFind the standard deviation of these numbers by typing `sd(b)`.\n\n10.\tDraw a histogram of these numbers by typing `hist(b)`.\n\n## Task Four: z scores\n\n11.\tMake a new object b_z and assign to it the z scores of the values from b:\n``\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nb_z <- scale(b)\n```\n:::\n\n\n12.\tCheck that it worked by typing `b_z`.\n\n13.\tDraw a histogram of b_z by typing `hist(b_z)`.\n\n# Part Two: extra practice\n\n## Task Five: investigating distributions\n\n14.\tLet’s make three new objects, with the marks from three people’s university masters courses. They are called annie, saj, and carrie and they took 10 courses each. We use the special notation `c()` to indicate a list, each number in the list is separated by a comma. Type the following into the console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nannie <- c(55, 95, 85, 65, 65, 85, 65, 95, 65, 75)\nsaj <- c(65, 85, 95, 75, 65, 55, 55, 75, 95, 85)\ncarrie <- c(75, 65, 95, 95, 55, 85, 75, 55, 95, 55)\n```\n:::\n\n\n15.\tWho has the highest average (mean) score for their course? \n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\nuse the `mean()` function\n:::\n\n16.\tWho has the most variable scores for their course?\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\nuse the `sd()` function\n:::\n\n\n17.\tWhat is the median score for each student?. What does this mean about the distribution of each students’ scores? Use the function `hist()` to draw the distributions to help you see.\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Hint\nyou can use the `summary()` function, or the `median()` function\n:::\n\n## Task Six: standardised scores: Z scores\n\n18.\tMake a new object called `annie_z` and use the function `scale` to convert annie’s scores to z-scores: in the console type:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nannie_z <- scale(annie)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n19.\tYou can have a look at the standardised scores of annie, by just typing `annie_z`. To what did annie’s highest initial score of 95 convert to?\n\n20.\tWhat is the mean and standard deviation of annie_z’s standardised scores?\n\n21.\tDraw a histogram of annie’s standardised scores, in the console type `hist(annie_z)`. What is the peak frequency value?\n\n22.\tBonus extra: If you want to find out the proportion of scores lower than a particular score you can do it like this in R-studio: `pnorm(x)` where x is the z-score you’re interested in. What is the proportion of scores lower than annie’s highest grade score?\n\n# Part Three: Extras\n\nIf you’ve whizzed through the previous tasks, then you can move on to the following activities to explore further the functionality of R studio.\n\n## Task Seven: Exploring operators. \n\nSo far, we’ve just looked at `+` as an operator. Go to this page: https://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html\n\n23.\t In the console, assign the object `d` to be 100 multiplied by 246.\n\n24.\tIn the console, assign the object `e` to be 84 divided by 32.1.\n\n25.\tAssign the variable `f` to 8 to the power of 4 (in R this is called exponentiation).\n\n26.\tWhat is the result of `d` added to `e` all divided by `f`\n\nTask 9: Exploring functions\n\nSo far, we’ve just looked at the square root function `sqrt()`. Go to this page:\nhttps://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html\n27.\tWhat is the result of `abs(-5.3)`? What does the `abs` function do?\n\n28.\tUsing the `seq()` function, generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to 30 in intervals of 3.\n\n29.\tAssign the sequence generated in step 28 to a new object. Now compute the mean of the sequence of numbers. (remember that objects can be a single number, or a sequence of numbers (called an array or a vector) or anything you want to put into it – remember, think of objects as buckets).\n\n::: {.callout-warning icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\n## Stuck? Here's the solution\nTry out the following code, pay special attention to how the sentences above \"convert\" into R code.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsequence <- seq(0,30, 3)\nmean(sequence)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n",
