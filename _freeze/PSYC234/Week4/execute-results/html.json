In other words, supervision on dissertation performance is significant (*p* < .001). A change in one unit of supervision is associated with an increase in dissertation performance of 0.44.\n\nThere is an effect that can be tested for mediation.\n\n#### Step 2: Test the a pathway of the indirect effect\n\n$$\nM = b_0 + b_1 * X + e\n$$\na second simple regression model, using X as a predictor but this time, M (self esteem here) is our outcome variable:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(fit_indirecta <- summary(lm(M ~ X, d)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = M ~ X, data = d)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.34553 -0.48838  0.02337  0.61288  1.49353 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

A change in one unit of supervision is associated with an increase in self-esteem of 0.30.\n\nSo now we know that X and M share some variance - they are correlated.  We have met one of the assumptions that we need to be able to perform a mediation analysis.\n\n#### Step 3 & 4: Test the b pathway of the indirect effect & the direct effect (pathway c')\n\n$$\nY = b_0 + b_1 * X + b_2 * M + e\n$$\nA multiple regression model, with Y (dissertation performance) as our outcome variable, and X (supervision) and M (self-esteem) as predictors.  Remember that this model is controlling for the effect of X on Y, because interpreting one predictor in a multiple regression model always assumes that the effect of the other predictors are already taken care of, or controlled for.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(fit_indirectb <- summary(lm(Y ~ X + M, d)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Y ~ X + M, data = d)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.39749 -0.48798  0.02245  0.44603  1.29565 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

A change in one unit of self-esteem is associated with an increase in dissertation-performance of 0.68 of a unit. The predictor (X) relationship with the outcome (Y and pathway c' - the direct effect) remains significant also (*p* < .02 , but reduced relative to the step 1 model coefficient (step 1 $b$ = 0.44, step 4 $b$ = 0.23).  \n\nSince the direct pathway c' is significant, we can say that we have a partially mediated effect of self-esteem on the relationship between supervision and dissertation performance.  Supervision predicts self esteem and dissertation performance, while self esteem also predicts dissertation performance.\n\nIf instead the X coefficient in the model above had been > .05 i.e. no significant, we could have claimed a full or complete mediation of self esteem on the relationship between supervision and dissertation performance\n\n### Using the power of R and the `mediation` package\n\nThe `mediation` package is called by the library() function loaded at the top of the document.  \n\n - It takes the models for pathways a and b (`fit_indirecta` and `fitindirectb` here), \n - It needs us to tell it the name of the predictor or treatment variable and the name of the mediator variable as labelled in the models \n - and we set the `boot` argument to T for TRUE, to be able to generate confidence intervals on our co-efficients.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresults <- mediate(fit_indirecta, \n                   fit_indirectb, \n                   treat = 'X', \n                   mediator = 'M', \n                   boot = T, \n                   dropobs = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRunning nonparametric bootstrap\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(results)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCausal Mediation Analysis \n\nNonparametric Bootstrap Confidence Intervals with the Percentile Method\n\n               Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value    \nACME             0.2062       0.0625         0.40   0.006 ** \nADE              0.2313       0.0390         0.41   0.020 *  \nTotal Effect     0.4375       0.2220         0.65  <2e-16 ***\nProp.

This is the X coefficient in our `fit_indirectb`\n - **Total Effect** does what it says on the tin.

The effect of supervision on dissertation performance and the effect of self-esteem on dissertation performance were independently significant predictors.  The indirect effect equals (.3)*(0.68) = .0.21.  We tested the significance of this indirect effect using bootstrapping procedures. We computed the average indirect effect over 1,000 bootstrapped samples with 95% confidence intervals (bootstrapped indirect effect = 0.21 95% CI [0.06, 0.38]). Since the confidence intervals do not cross zero, we infer statistical significance.\n\n\n# Lab Tasks\n\nYou can download the .zip folder that's needed for this lab from [here](data/Wk4/Lab 4 Materials.zip), which contains a starter .Rmd file and the data needed.\n\nUse the lecture script as a model to help you.\n\n## Descriptive Statistics:  describe the variables:\n\n+ Prompts:  continuous / categorical?
